# Fact-reader
Selects facts at random from a text file and speaks them out to the user.

The folder consists of a text file full of facts. The script will ask the user regarding the number of facts they want to know. The user can then type a number between 1-9.
After this, the corresponding number of facts will be randomly selected from the file and will be read out to the user. The text-to-speech implementation was done using Google's
GTTS module.

The facts were taken from: https://github.com/anfederico/fact-bot/Facts.txt, https://github.com/assaf/dailyhi/blob/master/facts.txt

I thank the authors of these files.
